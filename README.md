Snippets repo

Hello! This is an online "repo" or blog or just a basic crud of how a person may store their snippets or strings or anything. Let's try to keep it to snippets only.
Installing

Need an internet browser. (Chrome, FireFox, Opera)

Description
Currently, the deployed iteration of the application is still very barebones, however, in the future iterations I hope to populate/seed the database with more substance and content. 
##Technologies used: Native JavaScript HTML5 CSS3 Visual Studio Code Google Chrome Browser Atom text editor

##Getting Started:

Here's the link to the game!

https://billhsiao.github.io/minesweeper/

Next steps:

Unsolved problems: refactoring the game and wrapping it up in as many objects as possible Trying out iterative and recursive methods and benchmarking the two, for micro-performance gains. Maybe eliminate the constructor class for board or maybe make board with more properties so that it warrants its own constructor class.

Refining it more.
